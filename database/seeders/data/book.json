These codes can encode a price of up to ‘99.99’ in GBP, USD or CAD only. These price codes will be picked up by some scanners and can make it easier for retailers to establish the recommended retail price for books. However, most scanners do not read this code at all, and it is not common practice for ISBN numbers to have this price code. If you wish to have a price code added for your ISBN, please indicate that you would like this, and what price and currency the price code should represent in the ‘additional information’ section when filling out your information.",
